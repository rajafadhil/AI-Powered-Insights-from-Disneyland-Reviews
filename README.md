# üè∞ AI-Powered Insights from Disneyland Reviews

A data analysis project using **IBM Granite LLM** to extract sentiment-based insights from user reviews across three Disneyland parks: California, Paris, and Hong Kong. This project combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) with advanced NLP through large language models (LLMs) to summarize reviews and uncover patterns in visitor experiences.

## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to extract insights from thousands of Disneyland reviews sourced from TripAdvisor. By combining data visualization with AI-based text summarization, we seek to:

- Understand visitor satisfaction and pain points
- Compare user sentiment across Disneyland California, Paris, and Hong Kong
- Showcase the value of LLMs (IBM Granite) in real-world review analysis

- `Review_Text`: Review content
- `Rating`: Score (1‚Äì5)
- `Branch`: Park location (California, Paris, Hong Kong)
- `Reviewer_Location`: Country of origin
- `Year_Visited`: Visit year

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Rating Distribution**  
   Majority of reviews have a 5-star rating, indicating high satisfaction.

2. **Review Volume by Park**  
   California has the highest number of reviews, followed by Paris and Hong Kong.

3. **Reviewer Location**  
   Top reviewers come from the US and UK, reflecting travel and proximity trends.

## ü§ñ AI Support Explanation

### How AI is Used

The IBM Granite LLM (Large Language Model) was used for:

1. **Summarization**  
   Generating concise summaries of reviews per park.

2. **Insight Extraction**  
   Identifying top 3 recurring praises and complaints per location.

3. **(Optional) Sentiment Classification**  
   Future work may include full-scale sentiment classification using LLM or ML models.

### Why Use LLMs

- Handles unstructured text effectively
- Understands context, sarcasm, and nuance
- Saves time vs manual or rule-based sentiment tagging

### Example Prompt

```text
From the following reviews, identify:
1. The top 3 most frequent complaints
2. The top 3 most frequent praises
